# **Restaurant Hygiene**

Inspired by the abrupt presence of COVID-19, I wanted to create an app that people could use to rate a restaurant's hygiene. To prevent spreading the virus, restaurant employees are required to wear masks and gloves in addition to their normal hand washing. This app will allow delivery people from DoorDash, Postmates, etc. or customers picking up their food to look for a restaurant and rate/review their hygiene.

### **Features:**
- User personal account
- Restaurant search by name, address, or phone number
- Restaurant search within certain distance
- Restaurant page will display average rating
- Rate and review restaurant's hygiene
- Save favorite restaurants
- User personal page of rates and reviews
- Full CRUD for rates and reviews

### **Tech used:**
- Back End
  - Knex
  - ExpressJS
  - NodeJS
  - Bcrypt
  - JSON Web Token
  - Axios

- Front End
  - ReactJS
  - Redux
  - Axios

- Geolocation provided by:
